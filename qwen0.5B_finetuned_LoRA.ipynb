Traditional methods, either absolute or relative, come with their limitations. Absolute positional embeddings assign a unique vector to each position, which though straightforward, doesn’t scale well and fails to capture relative positions effectively. Relative embeddings, on the other hand, focus on the distance between tokens, enhancing the model’s understanding of token relationships but complicating the model architecture.\n\nRoPE ingeniously combines the strengths of both. It encodes positional information in a way that allows the model to understand both the absolute position of tokens and their relative distances. This is achieved through a rotational mechanism, where each position in the sequence is represented by a rotation in the embedding space. The elegance of RoPE lies in its simplicity and efficiency, enabling models to better grasp the nuances of language syntax and semantics.\n\n<strong>The Mechanism of Rotary Positional Embeddings\n</strong>\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*9T_o7ZbLK4mOSKJb5WNxeg.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" width=\"600px\">\n<br><br>\n**RoPE introduces a novel concept**. Instead of adding a positional vector, it applies a rotation to the word vector. Imagine a two-dimensional word vector for “dog.” To encode its position in a sentence, RoPE rotates this vector. The angle of rotation (θ) is proportional to the word’s position in the sentence. For instance, the vector is rotated by θ for the first position, 2θ for the second, and so on. This approach has several benefits:\n\n**Stability of Vectors**: Adding tokens at the end of a sentence doesn’t affect the vectors for words at the beginning, facilitating efficient caching.\nPreservation of Relative Positions: If two words, say “pig” and “dog,” maintain the same relative distance in different contexts, their vectors are rotated by the same amount. This ensures that the angle, and consequently the dot product between these vectors, remains constant\n\n<strong>Matrix Formulation of RoPE</strong>\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*42x3x4KKqSIKoajakjGmLg.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" width=\"600px\">\n\n### 1.1.4 Swish-Gated Linear Unit (SwiGLU)\n\n<strong>What is swish?</strong>\n<br><br>\nSwish is a smooth, non-monotonic — function that does not consistently increase or decrease — activation function defined as :\n\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*tDJKko60ciqzXEKs99fC5g.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" width=\"600px\">\n<br><br>\nβ is a trainable parameter, but most implementations do not use it, setting β = 1 and simplifying the function to : swish(x) = x * sigmoid(x) which is equivalent to the Sigmoid Linear Unit or SiLU.\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*9ZNwhMAa9Ci36xOmEuMiOg.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" width=\"600px\">\n<br><br>\n\nSwish has been shown to outperform ReLU in many applications.

Using LoRA for fine-tuning\n<span style=\"font-size: 18px\">\n\n## 3.1 What is Low Rank Adaption (LoRA)?\n<strong>Key Features of LoRA</strong>\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: It reduces the number of trainable parameters, leading to lower memory usage during fine-tuning and inference.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: It minimizes matrix operations, reducing the computational workload on GPUs/TPUs and speeding up the fine-tuning process.\n- **Preservation of Pre-Trained Knowledge**: The original pre-trained model remains unchanged making it easy to revert to the base model when needed.\n- **Scalability**: It can be applied to various transformer-based models like GPT, BERT and T5 making it versatile for different tasks.\n- **Faster Fine-Tuning**: By updating fewer parameters, it accelerates the fine-tuning process compared to traditional methods.\n\n<strong>Architecture of LoRA</strong>\nLoRA is used with transformer-based models which are common in NLP tasks. Let's see how it works:\n\n- **Pre-Trained Backbone**: We start with a large transformer model like GPT or BERT that has already been trained on a range of data.\n- **Low-Rank Adaptation Layers**: It adds small low-rank matrices to the model’s attention mechanism. These matrices are the only parts of the model that get updated during fine-tuning.\n- **Frozen Original Parameters**: The original weights of the model are kept frozen. This means we don’t modify the entire model, just the added low-rank matrices.\n- **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: We fine-tune the low-rank matrices for the specific task such as sentiment analysis or translation while the rest of the model stays the same.\n<br><br>\nThis approach helps us adapt large models to new tasks without changing the entire structure making it more efficient.\n<br><br>\n\n<strong>Working of LoRA</strong>\n\nLoRA modifies the traditional fine-tuning process by introducing low-rank matrices into specific layers of a neural network allowing the model to adapt to new tasks without changing the entire model. Let's see how LoRA works:\n\n1. **Decomposing the Weight Matrix**\nInstead of updating the entire weight matrix during fine-tuning, it approximates it using two smaller low-rank matrices A and B. The adapted weight matrix (W') is calculated as:\n\n$$\nW = W' + BA\n$$\nHere W is the original weight matrix and A and B are the low-rank matrices. This decomposition allows the model to make task-specific adjustments without the need to retrain the entire model, drastically reducing the computational load.\n\n2. **Training Only the LoRA Parameters**\nDuring the fine-tuning process, only the low-rank matrices A and B are updated while the original model weights W remain frozen. This minimizes the number of parameters that need to be adjusted making fine-tuning faster and more memory-efficient compared to traditional methods where all model weights are updated.\n\n3. **Inference with Adapted Weights**\nAfter fine-tuning, the adapted weight matrix W′ is used for inference. This helps the model to make predictions for specific tasks, fine-tuned with minimal computational resources. Since only the low-rank matrices are updated, it maintains efficiency even during inference.\n\nBy using LoRA, we can adapt large pre-trained models to new tasks quickly and efficiently without the computational burden of full model fine-tuning.\n</span>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, TaskType\n\nlora_config = LoraConfig(\n    r=16,\n    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,\n    lora_dropout=0.1,\n    lora_alpha=32,\n    target_modules=['q_proj', 'v_proj']\n)\nif hasattr(model, \"peft_config\"):\n    model = model.unload()\nmodel = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)\n\n\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir=\"./qwen-math-finetuned\",\n    num_train_epochs=3,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=4,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,\n    learning_rate=2e-4,\n    weight_decay=0.01,\n    logging_steps=10,\n    eval_strategy=\"epoch\",\n    save_strategy=\"epoch\",\n    load_best_model_at_end=True,\n    metric_for_best_model=\"eval_loss\",\n    report_to=\"none\"\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-14T01:14:02.862808Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-14T01:14:02.863391Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-14T01:14:02.999307Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-14T01:14:02.863367Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-14T01:14:02.998545Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/peft/tuners/tuners_utils.py:282: UserWarning: Already found a `peft_config` attribute in the model.
